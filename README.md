💬 weText

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to weText, my real-time chat app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Whether you want to chat with friends, create multiple channels, or just see real-time updates, weText has you covered. ⚡

I built it to explore Socket.IO, Zustand, and modern React patterns while keeping a smooth, responsive experience for both desktop and mobile users.

🚀 Features

🔐 User Authentication – Sign up and log in securely

💬 Real-time Messaging – Chat instantly thanks to Socket.IO

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multiple Chat Rooms – Keep conversations organized

🗂 State Management with Zustand – Fast, lightweight, and efficient

🌓 Responsive UI – Looks great on phones, tablets, and desktops

🌐 MERN Stack Architecture – Clean separation of frontend and backend
